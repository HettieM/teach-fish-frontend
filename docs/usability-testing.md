### **Introduction**

- [TMTF introduction]
- Thank you for helping us today.
- My name is [name], I'm a web developer for Teach A Man To Fish working on this app and i'll be leading this talk, this is [name - wave] and they will be taking notes. And [name - wave] who you've already met is from Teach A Man To Fish.

- We're going to start with an ice breaker question:
  - If you could have any superpower what would it be?

### **Before we start**

- Here is the link where you can find the app (share on chat, offer help with zoom). [https://enterprise-adventure.netlify.app](https://enterprise-adventure.netlify.app/)
- We're testing the app, not you, so don't worry about making mistakes
- **Please be honest with us**, if there's something you don't like, you're not going to hurt our feelings and any type of feedback will help improve our app.
- Please ask **any questions** that you have throughout the testing, but we **might** **answer only at the end.**
- We're going to be taking notes and, if it's okay with you, recording the screen, this won't record your personal video, but also feel free to turn your camera off. Once we've written down everything that was said we'll delete the videos.
- We're going to share a google doc with you all now to write down any questions or feedback you have at ANY point in the demonstration. [Paste the below in the chat â†’ delegate the colours to each student]

  - It would be great if you could answer the two questions on the first page now.

### **Play around**

- We're now going to give you all 4 minutes just to look/click through the app.
- You can then go to the second page in the doc and add any thoughts you have during this time under "your feedback".
- (after 4 min) We will now give you 2 min each to share your first impressions of the app and general feedback with us.
- Any questions?

### **Tasks**

- Now we're going to ask if one person would mind volunteering sharing their screen and completing some small tasks for us, we're going to ask you to just walk through what you are doing at each step.....

_Reminders_:

- It's not possible for you to do anything wrong here, we are interested in how people interact with the app.
- If there's something you feel that is badly placed or you think is missing, please tell us.
- The most important thing to remember is to just relax and say whatever comes to mind as you're carrying out these tasks.

**The first task we'd like you to carry out is... (wait to complete to move to the next):**

1. Find the introduction page of the app, "play" the instructional video
2. Please could you try and sign up to the app?
3. Find the first mission and complete it
4. See what you have uploaded
5. Please log out

### **Wrap up**

- Before we finish with some wrap up discussion, there are some questions on the page 3 of the doc. We would appreciate it if you could answer them at your own time after we finish.
- Now we just have 2 questions to wrap up (go around):
  - How was your overall experience moving around the app?
  - Are there any features you do not think were necessary on the app?
- Is there anything else you would like us to know?

**Thank you ever so much for helping us!**

# Overall feedback

## _Positives_

- Every feature on the app was declared necessary by all users
- Mission of the app is clear
- Easy to navigate
- Just the right amount of inputs for the sign up
- 'Mission complete' page is very engaging. All users liked the confetti.
- Users liked to see their progress in task's page and the option to return to mission
- They prefer watching videos to reading text
- All users liked the colours, images and icons. Friendly UI.

_Some quotes:_

"I especially liked the learning space in the app, how there is room for improvement by redoing our tasks. It is very immersive, in the way that it forces us to use our latent creativity and imagination by guided missions which generally does not happen in our classrooms."

"It is really an effective app for the students who like to express their imagination power/knowledge with others."

## _Suggestions for future development_

- A place to showcase the best submissions
- Collaboration with other users
- Users wanted to be able to go back and edit their input when completing a mission, without having to start it all over again.
- Option to save your work even without finishing the mission, so when you log back in it is all there.
- Information about TAMTF in the about page
- Space to post difficulties users are facing while using the app and ask questions regarding the missions and tasks.
- Chatting feature
- Dark mode
- Profile editing
- Biometric authentication
